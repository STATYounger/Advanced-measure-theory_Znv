\chapter{Signed Measures}
\textit{Start the coming trip from \textcolor{blue}{finite signed measures}.}\\
Assume $(\Omega,\SA)$ be a measurable space, where $\Omega$ is a nonempty set equipped with a $\sigma-$algebra $\SA$ over $\Omega$.
\section{The Hahn-Jordan Decomposition}
\dfn{Finite signed measure}{
A function $\nu:\SA\to\mathbb{R}$ is called a finite signed measure on $(\Omega,\SA)$, if
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $\nu(\emptyset)=0$,
    \item $\nu$ is $\sigma-$additive.
\end{enumerate}
}
\nt{$\sigma-$additive: for arbitrary disjoint sets $A_1,A_2,A_3,\cdots\in\SA$,
\begin{align*}
    \nu(\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty}A_n)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\nu(A_n).
\end{align*}}
\qs{}{What is the difference to a finite measure?}
$\nu(A)$ may be negative for some sets $A\in\SA$.
\qs{}{Why has the series $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\nu(A_n)$ converge absolutely?}
Because the set $\bigcup_{n=1}A_n$ is invariant w.r.t.reorderings of the sets $A_1,A_2,\cdots$.

\ex{Finite signed measure $1$}{
\begin{align}
    \nu:=Q-P
\end{align}with finite measures $P,Q$ on $(\Omega,\SA)$.
}
\begin{myproof}
To prove that \(\nu := Q - P\) with finite measures \(P\) and \(Q\) on \((\Omega, \mathcal{A})\) is a finite signed measure, we need to verify that \(\nu\) satisfies the two conditions.

\textcolor{blue}{(1): \(\nu(\emptyset) = 0\)}

Since both \(P\) and \(Q\) are finite measures, they satisfy \(P(\emptyset) = 0\) and \(Q(\emptyset) = 0\). Thus,
\[ \nu(\emptyset) = Q(\emptyset) - P(\emptyset) = 0 - 0 = 0. \]
Hence, \(\nu(\emptyset) = 0\), satisfying condition (1).\\
\textcolor{blue}{(2):\(\nu\) is \(\sigma\)-additive.}
To show that \(\nu\) is \(\sigma\)-additive, we need to demonstrate that for any countable collection of disjoint sets \(\{A_n\}\) in \(\mathcal{A}\),
\[ \nu\left(\bigcup_{n=1}^\infty A_n\right) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \nu(A_n). \]

Since \(P\) and \(Q\) are finite measures, they are \(\sigma\)-additive. Therefore, we have
\[ P\left(\bigcup_{n=1}^\infty A_n\right) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty P(A_n) \]
and
\[ Q\left(\bigcup_{n=1}^\infty A_n\right) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty Q(A_n). \]

Now, consider \(\nu\) applied to the union of the disjoint sets \(\{A_n\}\):
\[
\nu\left(\bigcup_{n=1}^\infty A_n\right) = Q\left(\bigcup_{n=1}^\infty A_n\right) - P\left(\bigcup_{n=1}^\infty A_n\right).
\]

Using the \(\sigma\)-additivity of \(Q\) and \(P\), this becomes
\[
\nu\left(\bigcup_{n=1}^\infty A_n\right) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty Q(A_n) - \sum_{n=1}^\infty P(A_n).
\]

Since \(\nu(A_n) = Q(A_n) - P(A_n)\) for each \(n\), we have
\[
\sum_{n=1}^\infty \nu(A_n) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty (Q(A_n) - P(A_n)).
\]

Thus,
\[
\nu\left(\bigcup_{n=1}^\infty A_n\right) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty Q(A_n) - \sum_{n=1}^\infty P(A_n) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty (Q(A_n) - P(A_n)) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \nu(A_n).
\]

This shows that \(\nu\) is \(\sigma\)-additive, satisfying condition (2).

We have verified that \(\nu := Q - P\) satisfies both conditions confirming that \(\nu\) is indeed a finite signed measure.
\end{myproof}
\ex{Finite signed measure $2$}{
\begin{align}
    \nu(A):=\int_A f\,d\mu=\int\mathbf{1}_Af\,d\mu
\end{align}
with a measure $\mu$ on $(\Omega,\SA)$ and a function $f\in\mathcal{L}^1(\mu)$.i.e.,$f:\Omega\to\bar{\mathbb{R}}$ is $\SA-$measurable with $\int|f|\,d\mu<\infty$.
}
\begin{myproof}
    \textcolor{red}{Main idea: By means of linearity of integrals and dominated convergence.}\\
Given:
\begin{itemize}
    \item A measure \(\mu\) on \((\Omega, \mathcal{A})\).
    \item A function \(f \in \mathcal{L}^1(\mu)\), i.e., \(f: \Omega \to \bar{\mathbb{R}}\) is \(\mathcal{A}\)-measurable with \(\int |f| \, d\mu < \infty\).
\end{itemize}

\textcolor{blue}{Check Condition (1):\(\nu(\emptyset) = 0\).}

By definition,
\[ \nu(\emptyset) = \int_\emptyset f \, d\mu. \]

Since the integral over the empty set is zero,
\[ \nu(\emptyset) = 0. \]

\textcolor{blue}{Check Condition (2): \(\nu\) is \(\sigma\)-additive.}

By definition,
\[ \nu\left(\bigcup_{n=1}^\infty A_n\right) = \int_{\bigcup_{n=1}^\infty A_n} f \, d\mu. \]

Since the sets \(A_n\) are disjoint, we can apply the linearity and \(\sigma\)-additivity of the integral:

\[ \int_{\bigcup_{n=1}^\infty A_n} f \, d\mu = \int \mathbf{1}_{\bigcup_{n=1}^\infty A_n} f \, d\mu = \int \left( \sum_{n=1}^\infty \mathbf{1}_{A_n} \right) f \, d\mu. \]

By the Monotone Convergence Theorem (or Dominated Convergence Theorem), we have:

\[ \int \left( \sum_{n=1}^\infty \mathbf{1}_{A_n} \right) f \, d\mu = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \int \mathbf{1}_{A_n} f \, d\mu = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \nu(A_n). \]

Thus,
\[ \nu\left(\bigcup_{n=1}^\infty A_n\right) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \nu(A_n). \]

This shows that \(\nu\) is \(\sigma\)-additive, satisfying condition (2).

Since \(\nu\) satisfies both (1) and (2), we have shown that \(\nu(A) := \int_A f \, d\mu\) defines a finite signed measure on \((\Omega, \mathcal{A})\).

\[
\boxed{\nu(A) = \int_A f \, d\mu \text{ is a finite signed measure.}}
\]
\end{myproof}
\nt{Additivity: A finite signed measure $\nu$ is additive in the sense that
\begin{align}
    \nu(\bigcup^N_{n=1}A_n)=\sum_{n=1}^N\nu(A_n)

Let $\nu$ be a finite signed measure on $(\Omega,\SA)$. Show that for arbitary sets $B_1\subset B_2\subset B_3\subset\cdots$ in $\SA$,
\begin{align*}
    \nu(\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty}B_n)=\lim_{n\to\infty}\nu(B_n_
    ).
\end{align*}
Show that for arbitrary sets $C_1\supset C_2\supset C_3\supset\cdots$ in $\SA$,
\begin{align*}
    \nu(\bigcap_{n=1}^{\infty}C_n)=\lim_{n\to\infty}\nu(C_n).
\end{align*}
}
\begin{myproof}
    Let's prove the two statements given for a finite signed measure \(\nu\) on \((\Omega, \mathcal{A})\).

\textcolor{blue}{1. Monotone Convergence for Increasing Sequence of Sets}

Statement: For arbitrary sets \(B_1 \subset B_2 \subset B_3 \subset \cdots\) in \(\mathcal{A}\),
\[ \nu\left(\bigcup_{n=1}^\infty B_n\right) = \lim_{n \to \infty} \nu(B_n). \]


Define \(B = \bigcup_{n=1}^\infty B_n\). The sequence \(\{B_n\}\) is increasing, so \(B_n \subset B_{n+1}\) for all \(n\). 

Using the definition of \(\nu\) as a signed measure, we can express \(\nu(B)\) as the limit of \(\nu(B_n)\).

First, observe that:
\[ B = \bigcup_{n=1}^\infty B_n. \]

Since the \(B_n\) are increasing,
\[ \nu(B_n) \leq \nu(B_{n+1}) \]
for all \(n\). Thus, the sequence \(\{\nu(B_n)\}\) is monotone increasing.

Because \(\nu\) is a finite signed measure, it is bounded. Hence, the monotone sequence \(\{\nu(B_n)\}\) converges to its supremum:
\[ \lim_{n \to \infty} \nu(B_n) = \sup_n \nu(B_n). \]

Consider the \(\sigma\)-additivity of \(\nu\),we have shown that:
\[ \nu\left(\bigcup_{n=1}^\infty B_n\right) = \lim_{n \to \infty} \nu(B_n). \]

\textcolor{blue}{2. Monotone Convergence for Decreasing Sequence of Sets}

Statement: For arbitrary sets \(C_1 \supset C_2 \supset C_3 \supset \cdots\) in \(\mathcal{A}\),
\[ \nu\left(\bigcap_{n=1}^\infty C_n\right) = \lim_{n \to \infty} \nu(C_n). \]


Define \(C = \bigcap_{n=1}^\infty C_n\). The sequence \(\{C_n\}\) is decreasing, so \(C_{n+1} \subset C_n\) for all \(n\).

Using the definition of \(\nu\) as a signed measure, we can express \(\nu(C)\) as the limit of \(\nu(C_n)\).

First, observe that:
\[ C = \bigcap_{n=1}^\infty C_n. \]

Since the \(C_n\) are decreasing,
\[ \nu(C_{n+1}) \leq \nu(C_n) \]
for all \(n\). Thus, the sequence \(\{\nu(C_n)\}\) is monotone decreasing.

Because \(\nu\) is a finite signed measure, it is bounded. Hence, the monotone sequence \(\{\nu(C_n)\}\) converges to its infimum:
\[ \lim_{n \to \infty} \nu(C_n) = \inf_n \nu(C_n). \]

Consider the \(\sigma\)-additivity of \(\nu\),we have shown that:
\[ \nu\left(\bigcap_{n=1}^\infty C_n\right) = \lim_{n \to \infty} \nu(C_n). \]

We have proven both statements for a finite signed measure \(\nu\) on \((\Omega, \mathcal{A})\):

1. For an increasing sequence of sets \(\{B_n\}\):
\[ \nu\left(\bigcup_{n=1}^\infty B_n\right) = \lim_{n \to \infty} \nu(B_n). \]

2. For a decreasing sequence of sets \(\{C_n\}\):
\[ \nu\left(\bigcap_{n=1}^\infty C_n\right) = \lim_{n \to \infty} \nu(C_n). \]
\end{myproof}
\dfn{Positive and negative sets}{
Let $\nu$ be a finite signed measure on $(\Omega,\SA)$. A set $A_{\star}\subset\Omega$ is called $\nu-$positive if $A_{\star}\in\SA$ and 
\begin{align}
    \nu(A)\geq 0 \text{ for all }A\in\SA \text{ with }A\subset A_{\star}.
\end{align}
 A set $A_{\star}\subset\Omega$ is called $\nu-$negative if $A_{\star}\in\SA$ and 
\begin{align}
    \nu(A)\leq 0 \text{ for all }A\in\SA \text{ with }A\subset A_{\star}.
\end{align}
}
\mprop{Existence of nontrivial positive sets}{
Let $\nu$ be a finite signed measure on $(\Omega,\SA)$, and let $A_0\in\SA$ with $\nu(A_0)>0$. Then there exists a $\nu-$positive set $A_{\star}\subset A_0$ with  $\nu(A_{\star})\geq\nu(A_0)$.
}
\begin{myproof}
    Define
    \begin{align*}
        \delta_0:=\sup\{-\nu(B):B\in\SA,B\subset A_0\}\geq 0.
    \end{align*}Write $A_0=A_1\cup B_1$ with \textcolor{blue}{disjoint measurable sets $A_1$ and $B_1$} such that
    \begin{align*}
        -\nu(B_1)\geq\min\{\frac{\delta_0}{2},1\}.
    \end{align*}[Iterated]:After $k$ steps we have measurable sets $A_0\supset A_1\supset\cdots\supset A_k$, and we consider the number 
    \begin{align*}
        \delta_k:=\sup\{-\nu(B):B\in\SA,B\subset A_k\}\geq 0.
    \end{align*}Then we write $A_k=A_{k+1}\cup B_{k+1}$ with disjoint measurable sets $A_{k+1}$ and $B_{k+1}$ such that 
    \begin{align*}
        -\nu(B_{k+1})\geq\min\{\frac{\delta_k}{2},1\}.
    \end{align*}This construction yields a non-increasing sequence $(A_k)_{k\geq 0}$ and the disjoint sets $B_k=A_{k-1}\backslash A_k,k\geq 1$. We may write 
    \begin{align*}
        A_0=A_{\star}\cup B_{\star}
    \end{align*}with the disjoint sets
    \begin{align*}
        A_{\star}=\cap_{k\geq 0}A_k\text{ and }B_{\star}=\cup_{k\geq 1}B_k.
    \end{align*}Since $\nu(B_{\star})=\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\nu(B_k)$ with nonpositive summands $\nu(B_k)$, we obtain the inequality
    \begin{align*}
        \nu(A_{\star})=\nu(A_0)-\nu(B_{\star})\geq\nu(A_0).
    \end{align*}Moreover, the sequence $(\nu(B_k))_{k\geq 1}$ converges to $0$, so the inequalities 
    \begin{align*}
       0\leq \min\{\frac{\delta_k}{2},1\}\leq -\nu(B_{k+1})\Rightarrow \lim_{k\to\infty}\delta_k=0.
    \end{align*}Consequently, for any measurable set $A\subset A_{\star}$,
    \begin{align*}
        -\nu(A)\leq\inf_{k\geq 0}\sup\{-\nu(A'):A'\in\SA,A'\subset A_k\}=\inf_{k\geq 0}\delta_k=0,
    \end{align*}whence $\nu(A)\geq0$. This shows that $A_{\star}$ is a $\nu-$positive set.
\end{myproof}
\ex{Unions of positive sets}{
Let $\nu$ be a finite signed measure on $(\Omega,\SA)$. Let $(A_n)_{n\geq 1}$ be a sequence of $\nu-$positive sets. Show that $A_{\star}:=\cup_{n\geq 1}A_n$ is also $\nu-$positive and satisfies
\begin{align*}
    \nu(A_{\star})\geq \sup_{n\geq 1}\nu(A_n).
\end{align*}
}
\thm{Hahn-Jordan decomposition}{
Let $\nu$ be a finite signed measure on $(\Omega,\SA)$.Then $\Omega=\Omega_+\cup\Omega_-$ with disjoint sets $\Omega_+,\Omega_-$ such that $\Omega_+$ is $\nu-$positive and $\Omega_-$ is $\nu-$negative.

\nt{Note that
\begin{align*}
    \nu^+(A)&:=\nu(A\cap \Omega_+)\\
    \nu^-(A)&:=-\nu(A\cap\Omega_-)
\end{align*}defines two finite measures $\nu^+,\nu^-$ on $(\Omega,\SA)$ such that $\nu=\nu^+-\nu^-$, and these two measures have disjoint support in the sense that $\nu^+(\Omega_-)=\nu^-(\Omega_+)=0$.
}
Furthermore, $|\nu|:=\nu^++\nu^-$ defines a finite measure on $(\Omega,\SA)$ such that for any $A\in\SA$,
\begin{align}
    \nu(A)=\int_A f\,d|\nu|,
\end{align}where $f:=1_{\Omega_+}-1_{\Omega_-}$.
\ex{ }{If $\nu(A)=\int_Af\,d\mu$ for some measure $\mu$ on $(\Omega,\SA)$ and a function $f\in\mathcal{L}(\mu)$,then a Hahn-Jordan decomposition is given by
\begin{align*}

\end{align*}
The measures $\nu^+,\nu^-$ and $|\nu|$ mentioned are given by $\nu^{\pm}(A):=\int_Af^{\pm}\,d\mu$ and $|\nu|(A):=\int_A|f|\,d\mu$.}
\ex{}{Let $P$ and $Q$ be finite measures on $\mathbb{R}$ with densities $f$ and $g$, respectively, with respect to Lebesgue measure. Determine a Hahn-Jordan decomposition of $\nu:=Q-P$ in terms of $f$ and $g$.}
\sol{ \textcolor{red}{To determine a Hahn-Jordan decomposition of the signed measure \(\nu := Q - P\) in terms of the densities \(f\) and \(g\), we need to decompose \(\nu\) into its positive and negative parts}.\\
Given:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \(P\) and \(Q\) are finite measures on \(\mathbb{R}\).
    \item \(P\) has a density \(f\) with respect to the Lebesgue measure \(\lambda\), so \(dP = f \, d\lambda\).
    \item \(Q\) has a density \(g\) with respect to the Lebesgue measure \(\lambda\), so \(dQ = g \, d\lambda\).
\end{itemize}
The signed measure \(\nu\) can be expressed in terms of its density w.r.t the Lebesgue measure:
\[
\nu := Q - P \implies d\nu = g \, d\lambda - f \, d\lambda = (g - f) \, d\lambda.
\]
To find the Hahn-Jordan decomposition of \(\nu\), we decompose it into its positive and negative variations, \(\nu = \nu^+ - \nu^-\), where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \(\nu^+\) is the positive part of \(\nu\).
    \item \(\nu^-\) is the negative part of \(\nu\).
\end{itemize}
We need to identify the sets where the density \(g - f\) is positive and where it is negative:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Let \(A = \{x \in \mathbb{R} \mid g(x) \ge f(x)\}\).
    \item Let \(B = \{x \in \mathbb{R} \mid g(x) < f(x)\}\).
\end{itemize}
On the set \(A\), \(g(x) - f(x) \ge 0\), so the density \((g - f)^+ = g - f\) on \(A\).
On the set \(B\), \(g(x) - f(x) < 0\), so the density \((g - f)^- = f - g\) on \(B\).

The positive and negative parts of the measure \(\nu\) can then be written as:
\(\nu^+\) has the density \((g - f)^+\):
\[
d\nu^+ = \max(g - f, 0) \, d\lambda.
\]
\(\nu^-\) has the density \((g - f)^-\):
\[
d\nu^- = \max(f - g, 0) \, d\lambda.
\]

Therefore, the Hahn-Jordan decomposition of \(\nu\) is:
\[
\nu = \nu^+ - \nu^-,
\]
where
\[
d\nu^+ = \max(g - f, 0) \, d\lambda \quad \text{and} \quad d\nu^- = \max(f - g, 0) \, d\lambda.
\]

In summary, we have:
\begin{itemize}
    \item  \(\nu^+\) is the measure with density \(\max(g - f, 0)\) with respect to the Lebesgue measure.
    \item \(\nu^-\) is the measure with density \(\max(f - g, 0)\) with respect to the Lebesgue measure.
\end{itemize}

\section{Radon-Nikodym Derivatives}
Consider measures $P$ and $Q$ on $(\Omega,\SA)$ and investigate under which conditions $Q$ has a density $f$ w.r.t. $P$. That means,$f:\Omega\to[0,\infty)$ is an $\SA-$measurable function such that 
\begin{align}
    Q(A)=\int_Af\,dP\text{ for all } A\in\SA.
\end{align}Such a function $f$ is also called a Radon-Nikodym derivative of $Q$ w.r.t. $P$,and is sometimes abbreviated as 
\begin{align}
    f=\frac{\,dQ}{\,dP}.
\end{align}If a density of $Q$ w.r.t. $P$ exists, arbitrary integrals w.r.t.$Q$ may be written as integrals w.r.t.$P$.
\mlenma{}{
Suppose that $Q$ has a density $f$ w.r.t. $P$ in the sense of $Q(A)=\int_Af\,dP\text{ for all } A\in\SA$. Then for arbitrary $\SA-$measurable functions $h:\Omega\to\bar{\mathbb{R}}$,
\begin{align}
    \int h\,dQ=\int hf\,dP
\end{align}whenever one of the two integrals is well-defined in $\bar{\mathbb{R}}$.
}
\begin{myproof}
    Assumption $ Q(A)=\int_Af\,dP\text{ for all } A\in\SA$ is equivalent to $ \int h\,dQ=\int hf\,dP$ for arbitrary indicator functions $h=1_A,A\in\SA$. By linearity of integrals, $ \int h\,dQ=\int hf\,dP$ holds true for "simple functions"$h$, that means, functions  $h=\sum_{j=1}^m\lambda_j1_{A_j}$ with $m\in\mathbb{N}$, constants $\lambda_j\geq 0$ and sets $A_j\in\SA$. For an arbitrary measurable function $h:\Omega\to[0,\infty]$, there exists a sequence $(h_n)_n$ of simple functions such that $(h_n)_n\uparrow h$ pointwise. \\
    A standard construction is given by
    \begin{align*}
        h_n(\omega):=2^{-n}\sum_{j=1}^{n2^n}1_{[h(\omega)\geq 2^{-n}j]}.
    \end{align*}But then $(h_nf)_n\uparrow hf$, so by monotone convergence,
    \begin{align*}
        \int h\,dQ=\lim_{n\to\infty} \int h_n\,dQ=\lim_{n\to\infty}\int h_nf\,dP=\int hf\,dP.
    \end{align*}Any measurable function $h:\Omega\to\bar{\mathbb{R}}$ may be written as $h=h^+-h^-$ with $h^{\pm}=(\pm h)\vee 0$. Then $(hf)^{\pm}=h^{\pm}f$, because $f\geq 0$ and $\int h^{\pm}\,dQ=\int(hf)^{\pm}\,dP$. Hence,
    \begin{align*}
        \int f\,dQ&=\int h^+\,dQ-\int h^-\,dQ\\
        &=\int (fh)^+\,dP-\int (hf)^-\,dP\\
        &=\int hf \,dP,
    \end{align*}whenever these differences are well-defined in $\bar{\mathbb{R}}$.
\end{myproof}
\cor{}{
Let $P,Q$ and $R$ be measures on $(\Omega,\SA)$ such that densities $f=\frac{\,dQ}{\,dP}$ and $g=\frac{\,dR}{\,dQ}$ exist. Then $fg=\frac{\,dR}{\,dP}$. Furthermore, if $f>0$, then $f^{-1}=\frac{\,dP}{\,dQ}$.

\begin{myproof}
    For any set $A\in\SA$,

        \int_A fg\,dP=\int 1_Agf\,dP=\int 1_Ag\,dQ=\int_Ag\,dQ=R(A),

    In case of $f>0$, for any $A\in\SA$,
    \begin{align*}
        P(A)=\int1_A\,dP=\int 1_A f^{-1}f\,dP=\int 1_A f^{-1}\,dQ=\int_A f^{-1}\,dQ.

        P(A)=\int_Ap\,dP_0\text{ for all } A\in\SA.
    \end{align}
\end{enumerate}}
\begin{myproof}
    Suppose that $P(A)=\int_Ap\,dP_0\text{ for all } A\in\SA$. Then $\Omega=\cup_{n\geq 1}A_n$ with $A_n:=\{p\leq n\}$ and 
    \begin{align*}
        P(A_n)\leq nP_0(A_n)\leq n \text{ for all } n.
    \end{align*}
    Thus, $P$ is $\sigma-$finite.\\
    Because $\Omega=\cup_{m\geq 1}\{p\geq m^{-1}\}$,this implies $P(\Omega)>0$,\\
    so $P(\{p\geq m^{-1}\})\geq m^{-1}P_0(\{p\geq m^{-1}\})>0$ for sufficiently large $m$.\\
    Suppose that $P$ is nonzero and $\sigma-$finite. In case of $P(\Omega)<\infty$,condition (2) is satisfied with $P_0$ is satisfied with $P_0:=P(\Omega)^{-1}P$ and $p=P(\Omega)$. In case of $P(\Omega)=\infty$,let $\Omega=\cup_{n=1}^{\infty}A_n$ with sets $A_n\in\SA$ such that $P(A_n)<\infty$. We may assume w.l.o.g that these sets $A_n$  are pairwise disjoint with $P(A_n)>0$. But then 
    \begin{align*}
        P_0(A):=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}2^{-n}P(A_n)^{-1}P(A\cap A_n)
    \end{align*}defines a probability measure on $(\Omega,\SA)$ and for any $A\in\SA$,
    \begin{align*}
        P(A)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}2^nP(A_n)P_0(A\cap A_n)=\int_Ap\,dP_0
    \end{align*}with $p(\omega):=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}2^nP(A_n)1_{A_n}(\omega)>0$.

    \item $Q$ is absolutely continuous w.r.t. $P$.

In case of $(1-2)$, the density $f$ is $P-$almost everywhere unique. That means \textcolor{red}{if $\Tilde{f}$ is another density of $Q$ w.r.t. $P$, then $P(\{\Tilde{f}\neq f\})=0$}.

    Suppose that condition  $(1)$ is satisfied. If $P$ and $Q$ are finite, the existence of a density $f=\frac{\,dQ}{\,dP}$ is a consequence. In the general case, let $P_0$ and  $Q_0$ be probability measures on $(\Omega,\SA)$ such that there exist strictly positive densities $p=\frac{\,dP}{\,dP_0}$ and $q=\frac{\,dQ}{\,dQ_0}$. Then

    The lemma implies that for any $\SA-$measurable function $h:\Omega\to[0,\infty)$,
    \begin{align*}
        \int h\,dQ=\int hq\,dQ_0=\int hqf_0\,dP_0=\int hqf_0p^{-1}\,dP,
    \end{align*}so $f:=qf_0p^{-1}=\frac{\,dQ}{\,dP}$.\\
    Suppose that $\Tilde{f}$ is another version of $\frac{\,dQ}{\,dP}$. Then,$\Tilde{f}_0:=q^{-1}\Tilde{f}p$ is another version of $\frac{\,dQ_0}{\,dP_0}$, and $\{\Tilde{f}_0\neq f_0\}=\{\Tilde{f}\neq f\}$. Hence,

\chapter{Abstract Integrals}
Define a measure $\mu$ on $\SA$, which leads to the integral $\int f\,d\mu$ of measurable functions $f:\Omega\to[0,\infty]$ or $f:\Omega\to\mathbb{R}$. If we restrict our attention to the set $\mathcal{L}^1(\mu)$ of real-valued,measurable functions $f$ on $\Omega$ such that $\int|f|\,d\mu<\infty$, then the integral $\int f\,d\mu$ has the following essential properties:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Linearity: The set $\mathcal{L}^1(\mu)$ is a real vector space (with the pointwise addition of functions and the pointwise multiplication of functions with scalars), and $f\mapsto \int f\,d\mu$ is linear in $f\in\mathcal{L}^1(\mu)$.
    \item Positivity: If $f\in\mathcal{L}^1(\mu)$ is nonnegative, then $\int f\,d\mu\geq 0$.
    \item Monotone convergence: If $(f_n)_n$ is a sequence of nonnegative functions in $\mathcal{L}^1(\mu)$ which is pointwise increasing with limit $f\in\mathcal{L}^1(\mu)$,then $\int f_n\,d\mu\to\int f\,d\mu$ as $n\to\infty$.
\end{itemize}
\nt{\begin{enumerate}
    \item $\mathcal{F}$ is a real vector space of real-valued functions on a set $\Omega$.
    \item $J:\mathcal{F}\to\mathbb{R}$ is a linear and positive functional satisfying monotone convergence.
\end{enumerate}}
\qs{}{
Does there exist a $\sigma-$algebra $\mathcal{A}$ over $\Omega$ and a measure $\mu$ on $\mathcal{A}$ such that $\mathcal{F}\subset\mathcal{L}^1(\mu)$ and $J(f)=\int f\,d\mu$

\section{Lattices and Stone Lattices}
For two functions $f,g:\Omega\to[-\infty,\infty]$, the inequalities $f\leq g$ or $f\geq g$ are always meant pointwise. Their pointwise maximum and minimum are denoted with $f\vee g$ and $f\wedge g$,respectively, that is,
\begin{align}
    f&\vee g(\omega):=\max\{f(\omega),g(\omega)\}\\
    f&\wedge g(\omega):=\min\{f(\omega),g(\omega)\}. 
\end{align}Similarly, the pointwise maximum and minimum of $f$ and a real constant $c$ is denoted with $f\vee c$ and $f\wedge c$, respectively. Specifically, we write
\begin{align*}
    f^+&:=f\vee 0\\
    f^-&:=(-f)\wedge 0=-(f\vee 0),
\end{align*}so $f=f^+-f^-$ and $|f|=f^++f^-$.
\dfn{Lattice and Stone lattice.}{
The linear function space $\mathcal{F}$ is called a lattice if $|f|\in\mathcal{F}$ for any $f\in\mathcal{F}$.\\
A lattice $\mathcal{F}$ is called a stone lattice if $f\wedge 1\in\mathcal{F}$ for arbitrary $f\in\mathcal{F}$.

Let $(\Omega,d)$ be a metric space. Then the following sets of functions $f:\Omega\to\mathbb{R}$ are Stone lattices:

    \item $\mathcal{C}_b(\Omega)=\{f:\text{continuous and bounded}\}$,

    \item $\mathcal{C}_{Lip,b}(\Omega)=\{f:\text{Lipschitz-continuous and bounded}\}$.

From now on, let $\mathcal{F}$ be a Stone lattice. The set of nonnegative functions in $\mathcal{F}$ is denoted with $\mathcal{F}^+$,that is,

\dfn{Abstract integral.}{
A function $J:\mathcal{F}\to\mathbb{R}$ is called an abstract integral (on the Stone lattice $\mathcal{F}$) if it has the following three properties:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Linearity: For $f,g\in\mathcal{F}$ and $\lambda\in\mathbb{R}$,
    \begin{align}
        J(\lambda f)&=\lambda J(f)\\
        J(f+g)&=J(f)+J(g).
    \end{align}
    \item Positive: $J(f)\geq 0$ for all $f\in\mathcal{F}^+$.
    \item Monotone convergence: Let $(f_n)_n$ be a pointwise increasing sequence of functions $f_n\in\mathcal{F}^+$ with limit $f\in\mathcal{F}$. Then,
    \begin{align}
        \lim_{n\to\infty}J(f_n)=J(f).
    \end{align}
\end{enumerate}
}Linearity and positivity of an abstract integral $J$ on $\mathcal{F}$ imply that 
\begin{align*}
    J(f)\leq J(g)\text{ whenever }f,g\in\mathcal{F}\text{ with }f\leq g.
\end{align*}
\ex{}
{    Let $\mathcal{F}$ be the set of all functions (sequences) $f : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$ such that $\lim_{\omega \to \infty} f(\omega)$ exists in $\mathbb{R}$. Verify that $\mathcal{F}$ is a Stone lattice. Does $\mathcal{J}(f) := \lim_{\omega \to \infty} f(\omega)$ define an abstract integral on $\mathcal{F}$?}
\begin{myproof}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Verify that \(\mathcal{F}\) is a Stone Lattice
\begin{itemize}
    \item Lattice Structure:\\
\(\mathcal{F}\) is closed under pointwise addition and scalar multiplication. This means for any \(f, g \in \mathcal{F}\) and \(\alpha \in \mathbb{R}\), \(f + g \in \mathcal{F}\) and \(\alpha f \in \mathcal{F}\).\\
 Pointwise maximum (\(\vee\)) and minimum (\(\wedge\)) of two functions in \(\mathcal{F}\) also belong to \(\mathcal{F}\). For \(f, g \in \mathcal{F}\), define:
     \begin{align*}
       (f \vee g)(\omega) &= \max(f(\omega), g(\omega))\\
     (f \wedge g)(\omega) &= \min(f(\omega), g(\omega))  
     \end{align*}
Both \(\max(f(\omega), g(\omega))\) and \(\min(f(\omega), g(\omega))\) have limits as \(\omega \to \infty\), since the limit of a bounded sequence of real numbers exists.

\item Distributive Property:\\
For all \(f, g, h \in \mathcal{F}\):
     \begin{align*}
     f \vee (g \wedge h) = (f \vee g) \wedge (f \vee h)
     \end{align*}
This follows from the properties of \(\max\) and \(\min\) functions.

\item Pseudocomplement:\\
The pseudocomplement of a function \(f \in \mathcal{F}\) is another function \(g \in \mathcal{F}\) such that \(f \wedge g = 0\) (pointwise zero) and \(f \vee g\) is the smallest function with this property.
\end{itemize}
Therefore, \(\mathcal{F}\) satisfies the requirements to be a Stone lattice.

\item Abstract Integral \(\mathcal{J}(f) := \lim_{\omega \to \infty} f(\omega)\)\\
To determine if \(\mathcal{J}(f) = \lim_{\omega \to \infty} f(\omega)\) defines an abstract integral on \(\mathcal{F}\), we need to check if it satisfies the properties of an integral:
\begin{itemize}
\item Linearity:
For \(f, g \in \mathcal{F}\) and \(\alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{R}\):
     \begin{align*}
     \mathcal{J}(\alpha f + \beta g) = \lim_{\omega \to \infty} (\alpha f(\omega) + \beta g(\omega)) = \alpha \lim_{\omega \to \infty} f(\omega) + \beta \lim_{\omega \to \infty} g(\omega) = \alpha \mathcal{J}(f) + \beta \mathcal{J}(g)
     \end{align*}
This shows that \(\mathcal{J}\) is linear.

\item Monotonicity:\\
If \(f \leq g\) pointwise, then \(\mathcal{J}(f) \leq \mathcal{J}(g)\) because limits preserve the order of sequences:
     \begin{align*}
     \text{If } f(\omega) \leq g(\omega) \text{ for all } \omega, \text{ then } \lim_{\omega \to \infty} f(\omega) \leq \lim_{\omega \to \infty} g(\omega)
     \end{align*}
Therefore, \(\mathcal{J}\) is monotone.

\item Positivity:If \(f \geq 0\) pointwise, then \(\mathcal{J}(f) \geq 0\).
\end{itemize}
Given these properties, \(\mathcal{J}(f) = \lim_{\omega \to \infty} f(\omega)\) defines an abstract integral on \(\mathcal{F}\).
\end{enumerate}
Conclusion:
\(\mathcal{F}\), the set of all functions \(f : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}\) such that \(\lim_{\omega \to \infty} f(\omega)\) exists, is a Stone lattice. The functional \(\mathcal{J}(f) := \lim_{\omega \to \infty} f(\omega)\) defines an abstract integral on \(\mathcal{F}\).

            \item Addition and Scalar Multiplication:\\
            If \(f, g \in \mathcal{F}\), then \(f + g \in \mathcal{F}\) because the sum of two functions that are nonzero on finite sets is also nonzero on a finite set.\\
            If \(\alpha \in \mathbb{R}\), then \(\alpha f \in \mathcal{F}\), provided that \(\alpha \neq 0\).

     For \(f, g \in \mathcal{F}\), \((f \vee g)(n) = \max(f(n), g(n))\) and \((f \wedge g)(n) = \min(f(n), g(n))\).\\
     Both \(\max(f(n), g(n))\) and \(\min(f(n), g(n))\) will be nonzero on finite sets if \(f\) and \(g\) are nonzero on finite sets.

   For all \(f, g, h \in \mathcal{F}\):
     \begin{align*}
         f \vee (g \wedge h) = (f \vee g) \wedge (f \vee h)
     \end{align*}
    
     This holds due to the properties of the maximum and minimum functions.

\item Pseudocomplement:\\
   The pseudocomplement of a function \(f \in \mathcal{F}\) can be considered as a function \(g \in \mathcal{F}\) such that \(f \wedge g = 0\) and \(f \vee g\) is the smallest function with this property.\\

Thus, \(\mathcal{F}\) satisfies the requirements to be a Stone lattice.

        \item Show that \(\mathcal{F}^* = [0, \infty]^\mathbb{N}\)
\(\mathcal{F}^*\) is the dual of \(\mathcal{F}\), representing all functions that are pointwise bounded above by non-negative sequences extending to infinity.\\
\(\mathcal{F}^* = [0, \infty]^\mathbb{N}\) means it includes all functions from \(\mathbb{N}\) to \([0, \infty]\).\\
Given that \(\mathcal{F}\) consists of functions that are zero except for finitely many points, every non-negative sequence in \([0, \infty]^\mathbb{N}\) can be represented in \(\mathcal{F}^*\).
\item Show that \(\mathcal{U}(\mathcal{F}) = \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})\)

\(\mathcal{U}(\mathcal{F})\) denotes the ultrafilter generated by \(\mathcal{F}\), which corresponds to the set of all subsets of \(\mathbb{N}\).\\
Since any subset of \(\mathbb{N}\) can be represented as the set where a function in \(\mathcal{F}\) is non-zero, \(\mathcal{U}(\mathcal{F}) = \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})\).\\
Every subset of \(\mathbb{N}\) can be generated by the finite non-zero sequences, demonstrating the equality with the power set \(\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})\).

Conclusion:
\begin{itemize}
\item \(\mathcal{F}\) is a Stone lattice.

\(\mathcal{F}^*\) represents the set of all functions that are pointwise bounded above by non-negative sequences extending to infinity. Given the context of \(\mathcal{F}\), it represents the dual functions:\\
\(\mathcal{F}^* = [0, \infty]^\Omega\) means it includes all functions from \(\Omega\) to \([0, \infty]\).\\
Since \(\mathcal{F}\) consists of functions that are zero except for finitely many points, every non-negative function in \([0, \infty]^\Omega\) can be represented in \(\mathcal{F}^*\).

\item Determine \(\mathcal{U}(\mathcal{F})\)\\

\(\mathcal{U}(\mathcal{F})\) denotes the ultrafilter generated by \(\mathcal{F}\), which corresponds to the set of all subsets of \(\Omega\).\\
Since any subset of \(\Omega\) can be represented as the set where a function in \(\mathcal{F}\) is non-zero, \(\mathcal{U}(\mathcal{F}) = \mathcal{P}(\Omega)\).\\
Every subset of \(\Omega\) can be generated by the finite non-zero sequences, demonstrating the equality with the power set \(\mathcal{P}(\Omega)\).

\item Determine \(\sigma(\mathcal{F})\)\\
\(\sigma(\mathcal{F})\) refers to the \(\sigma\)-algebra generated by \(\mathcal{F}\).\\
Given \(\mathcal{F}\) consists of functions that are non-zero only on finite sets, \(\sigma(\mathcal{F})\) will include all finite and cofinite subsets of \(\Omega\).\\
A cofinite set is one whose complement is finite, and these sets form a \(\sigma\)-algebra because they are closed under countable unions, intersections, and complements.
\end{enumerate}
Conclusion:
\begin{itemize}
\item \(\mathcal{F}\) is a Stone lattice.
\item \(\mathcal{F}^* = [0, \infty]^\Omega\).
\item \(\mathcal{U}(\mathcal{F}) = \mathcal{P}(\Omega)\).
\item \(\sigma(\mathcal{F})\) is the \(\sigma\)-algebra of all finite and cofinite subsets of \(\Omega\).

From now on, let $J:\mathcal{F}\to\mathbb{R}$ be an abstract integral. We extend $J$ to a functional on the extension $\mathcal{F}^{\star}$ of $\mathcal{F}^+$. For $g\in\mathcal{F}^{\star}$,let
\begin{align*}
    J(g):=\sup_{f\in\mathcal{F}^+:f\leq g}J(f).
\end{align*}
\nt{
If $g\in\mathcal{F}^+$,then $J(f)\leq J(g)$ for all $f\in\mathcal{F}^+$ such that $f\leq g$,so the new definition $J(g)$ yields the former value of $J(g)$. For $g,h\in\mathcal{F}^{\star}$,
\begin{align*}
    J(g)\leq J(h)\text{ if }g\leq h,
\end{align*}because $g\leq h\Rightarrow\{f:\mathcal{F}^+:f\leq g\}\subset\{f\in\mathcal{F}^+:f\leq g\}$.

\begin{myproof}
    Since $(f_n)_n$ is pointwise increasing,the sequence $(J(f_n))_n$ is increasing,and $f_n\leq g$ for each $n$,whence $J(g)\geq\lim_{n\to\infty}J(f_n)$.\\
    On the other hand,if $f$ is any fixed function on $\mathcal{F}^+$ such that $f\leq g$,then $(f_n\wedge f)_n$ is pointwise increasing with limit $f$. Consequently,
    \begin{align*}
        \lim_{n\to\infty}J(f_n)\geq \lim_{n\to\infty}J(f_n\wedge f)=J(f)\Rightarrow J(g)\leq\lim_{n\to\infty}J(f_n).

Let $X\in\mathcal{L}^1(P)$,and let $\psi:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$ be convex such that $\int\psi(X)\,dP<\infty$. Then

    \psi(\mathbb{E}(X|\SA_0))&\leq\mathbb{E}(\psi(X)|\SA_0)\text{ almost surely},\\
    \int\psi(\mathbb{E}(X|\SA_0))\,dP&\leq\int\psi(X)\,dP.
\end{align}
}
\begin{myproof}
    By the definition of conditional expectations,it suffices to show that for any fixed $A_0\in\SA_0$,
    \begin{align*}
        \int_{A_0}\psi(\mathbb{E}(X|\SA_0))\,dP\leq\int_{A_0}\mathbb{E}(\psi(X)|\SA_0)\,dP=\int_{A_0}\psi(X)\,dP.
    \end{align*}
    By the convexity of $\psi$,for any fixed $x_0\in\mathbb{R}$ there exists a slope $b(x_0)\in\mathbb{R}$ such that $\psi(x)\geq\psi(x_0)+b(x_0)(x-x_0)$ for all $x\in\mathbb{R}$.\\
    For arbitrary $x\in\mathbb{R}$,
    \begin{align*}
        \psi(x)=\sup_{x_0\in\mathbb{Q}}(\psi(x_0)+b(x_0)(x-x_0)),
    \end{align*}because $\psi$ is continuous and $b(\cdot)$ non-decreasing. Consequently,
    \begin{align*}
        \int_{A_0}\psi(\mathbb{E}(X|\SA_0))\,dP&=\int_{A_0}\sup_{x_0\in\mathbb{Q}}(\psi(x_0)+b(x_0)(\mathbb{E}(X|\SA_0)-x_0))\,dP\\
        &=\int_{A_0}\sup_{x_0\in\mathbb{Q}}\mathbb{E}(\psi(x_0)+b(x_0)(X-x_0)|\SA_0)\,dP\\
        &\leq\int_{A_0}\mathbb{E}(\psi(X)|\SA_0)\,dP.
    \end{align*}Use countability of $\mathbb{Q}$ to conclude that
    \begin{align*}
        \psi(x_0)+b(x_0)(\mathbb{E}(X|\SA_0)-x_0)&=\mathbb{E}(\psi(x_0)+b(x_0)(X-x_0)|\SA_0)\\
        &\leq \mathbb{E}(\psi(X)|\SA_0)
    \end{align*}simultaneously for all $x_0\in\mathbb{Q}$ almost surely.

\section{Conditional expectations as orthogonal projections}
Restrict our attention to the space $\mathcal{L}^2(P)\subset\mathcal{L}^1(P)$ of square-integrable random variables. If we identify random variables which are equal almost surely, we obtain the Hilbert space $\mathcal{L}^2(P)$ with inner product 
\begin{align}
    <X,Y>:=\int XY\,dP.
\end{align}and norm
\begin{align}
    \|X\|:=<X,X>^{\frac{1}{2}}=(\int X^2\\,dP)^{\frac{1}{2}}.
\end{align}
\nt{
One may view $\mathbb{E}(\cdot|_{\SA_0})$ as a continuous linear mapping from $\mathcal{L}^2(P)$ to its closed linear subspace $\mathcal{L}^2(P_{\SA_0})$. Apply Jensen's inequality with $\psi(x):=x^2$ leads to the inequality
\begin{align*}
    \int \mathbb{E}(X|\SA_0)^2\,dP\leq \int X^2\,dP.
\end{align*}
}
\thm{}{
The mapping $X\mapsto\mathbb{E}(X|_{\SA_0})$ is the orthogonal linear projection of $\mathcal{L}^2(P)$ onto $\mathcal{L}^2(P|_{\SA_0})$. Precisely,for arbitrary random variables $X\in\mathcal{L}^2(P)$ and $Y_0\in\mathcal{L}^2(P|_{\SA_0})$,
\begin{align}
    \|X-Y_0\|^2&=\|X-\mathbb{E}(X|\SA_0)\|^2+\|\mathbb{E}(X|\SA_0)-Y_0\|^2\\
    &\geq \|X-\mathbb{E}(X|\SA_0)\|^2
\end{align}with equality if and only if $Y_0=\mathbb{E}(X|\SA_0)$. In particular,
\begin{align}
    \|X\|^2=\|X-\mathbb{E}(X|\SA_0)\|^2+\|\mathbb{E}(X|\SA_0)\|^2\geq\|\mathbb{E}(X|\SA_0)\|^2

\begin{myproof}
    Suppose $X_0:=\mathbb{E}(X|\SA_0)$,by $<X,Y_0>=\int XY_0\,dP=\int X_0Y_0\,dP=<X_0,Y_0>$,whence
    \begin{align*}
        \|X-Y_0\|^2&=\|X\|^2-2<X,Y_0>+\|Y_0\|^2\\
        &=\|X\|^2-2<X_0,Y_0>+\|Y_0\|^2\\
        &=\|X\|^2-\|X_0\|^2+\|X_0\|^2-2<X_0,Y_0>+\|Y_0\|^2\\
        &=\|X\|^2-\|X_0\|^2+\|X_0-Y_0\|^2\\
        &\geq \|X\|^2-\|X_0\|^2
    \end{align*}with equality if and only if $Y_0=X_0$. In particular,setting $Y_0=X_0$ shows that $\|X-X_0\|^2=\|X\|^2-\|X_0\|^2$,which is equivalent to the second asserted equation $\|X\|^2=\|X-X_0\|^2+\|X_0\|^2$,and we obtain the general equality
    \begin{align*}
        \|X-Y_0\|^2=\|X-X_0\|^2+\|X_0-Y_0\|^2.

\section{Conditional expectations given another random variable}
Suppose that instead of the random outcome $\omega\in\Omega$ we only know $T(\omega)$ for some given measurable function $T:(\Omega,\SA)\to(\tau,\mathcal{B})$. This corresponds to the sub$-\sigma-$algebra
\begin{align}
    \sigma(T):=\{T^{-1}(B):B\in\mathcal{B}\}
\end{align}of $\mathcal{A}$. It is the smallest $\sigma-$algebra $\SA_0$ over $\Omega$ such that $T$ is $\SA_0-\mathcal{B}-$measurable. There is a simple result about $\sigma(T)-$measuable functions $X:\Omega\to\mathbb{R}$.
\thm{Lifting.}{
